# Call Center Analyzer

Use the Amazon Transcribe to prepare the transcription of the call and the Berdock with `Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet` model to prepare the tranlation and analyzis.

The Bedrock is prompted with following instruction:

```txt
        You are responsible for translation of the conversation of the call center agent
        of the OTT video service called Go3 with a customer.

        The conversation is generated by Transcribe service and is provided in the following format:
        
        <transcribe>
        time_stamp  speaker_label   text
        time_stamp  speaker_label   text
        </transcribe>

        1. Analyze the customer sentiment and the agent quality.
        Label it "1. Sentiment and Quality Analysis:"

        2. Analyze the speakers and decide, who is the agent and who is the customer. Note that there may be more than one customer speaking.
        Label it "2. Speaker Analysis:"

        3. Analyze the conversation made in {input_language_code} and translate it to English so it makes sense.
        Provide translated conversation with labels changed to "Customer" and "Agent".
        Include the original time stamps.
        Label it "3. Translated Conversation:"
```

The result is set to the SNS topic.
